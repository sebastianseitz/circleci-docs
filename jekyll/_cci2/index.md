Thank you for your interest in CircleCI 2.0.

We are in the process of adding documentation for 2.0. Some sections are empty and many new articles will be added in the coming days.

CircleCI 2.0 is a powerful tool. While it is in Beta you should be comfortable with YAML configuration files, writing shell commands and have some familiarity with Docker.

## Getting Started Articles for Beta users

- [First Steps](/docs/2.0/first-steps/)
- [FAQ](/docs/2.0/faq/)
- [Configuring CircleCI 2.0](/docs/2.0/configuration/)
- [Exceutor Types](/docs/2.0/executor-types/)
- [Managing Parallelism](/docs/2.0/managing-parallelism/)
- [Language Guides for Go, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby](/docs/2.0/language-guides)

We'll update this page as more articles are added during Beta.
