**Note:** We will be adding to this document during the Beta phase of CircleCI 2.0.

## Native Docker Support

With CircleCI 2.0, we treat Docker as a first-class citizen. If it works with Docker, it will work with CircleCI 2.0.

## Customizable Images

CircleCI 2.0 will empower developers with highly customizable build images. This allows teams to make images as lightweight or complex as their needs demand. Any language, any framework, any database and any variable is supported.
