# Contributing to CircleCI Docs

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the CircleCI documentation.

will continue to be improved, but will go into maintenance mode in the coming monnths. If you're considering contributing
a completely new article, we encourage you to wait until the 2.0 documentation is established.**

**Pull Requests for clarifications, technical accuracy, spelling fixes, and grammar improvements, are always welcome.**
