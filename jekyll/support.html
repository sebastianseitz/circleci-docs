<h2 id="support-info"><strong>Support Helpdesk Information</strong></h2>

<p>All customers on paid plans have access to engineering support via our helpdesk.</p>
<p>We aim to respond to urgent issues within 24 hours, and all other issues as soon as weâ€™re able.</p>
<p>Support operations are round-the-clock, Monday - Friday. Over weekends and US public holidays we check in on tickets for any urgent issues, but otherwise we'll respond once we're back at work.</p>
<p>We use an email ticket system. Our application is able to send additional information about your pojects and builds if you submit a ticket using the widget in the application from a screen where you're seeing a problem.</p>
